title: "ABOUT ME"
---






Hello, my name is Mari, I am currently a sophomore at Dominican University, pursuing a degree in Mathematics with a concentration in finance and actuarial studies.

I have lots of interest in various aspects of the the economy and finance as there has been a rise in problems regarding economic disparities, high unemployment rates etc.

My goal is to make people aware of some of these issues while providing data to represent and allow others to understand these issues.

I enjoy finding correlations between different subjects and finding out how one impacts another. My goal is to utilize my knowledge and skills in research and computer programming to express my findings on various topics.
